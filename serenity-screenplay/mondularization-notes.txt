Principles applied:
1. No specific instrumentation, i.e. no CGLib, no Lambdaj
2. No specific dependency injection, i.e. no Google Guice
3. No dependency on the Pages, PageObjects - requires Selenium and the Screenplay is the future
4. No dependency on WebDriver specifically Selenium stuff
5. Freemarker has a dependeency on Swing which rules most of the HTML replorting out
